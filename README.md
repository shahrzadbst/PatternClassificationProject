# PatternClassificationProject
Designing &amp; evaluating a support vector classifier for Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) Prediction. Steps: experiment design, blind test. Precision used as performance criteria at 50% recall. Trained linear SVM had poor precision; adopted meta-learning. Ensemble method (voting classifier) combines SVM with 4 classifiers via soft voting.
